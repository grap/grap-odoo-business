* It could be great to have the possibility to manage the certification
  document that provide certification organization with the following model
  ``res.company.certification`` and the fields ``company_id``,
  ``organization_id``, ``date_start``, ``date_end``

* In the same way, it could be great to have the possibility to store
  the certification document of each supplier with the following model
  ``res.partner.certification`` and the fields ``partner_id``,
  ``organization_id``, ``date_start``, ``date_end``

* Make a dependency to the new module ``product_net_weight`` and update
  algorithm + create a new module ``product_volumen_price``.
