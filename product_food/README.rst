This module extends the functionality of sale module to support food features.

It provides the new models:
* ``certifier.organization``

* ``product.allergen``

It also adds many fiels on product models. (templates and variants)

* ``is_alimentary``, boolean for analysis purpose.
* ``certifier_organization_id``
* ``is_uncertifiable`` for alimentary products that can not be certifiable.
  (like products that come from the sea)
* ``best_before_date_day`` that mentions for how many days a product can
  be eaten, after having packed. (for cheese, meats, etc.)
* ``is_alcohol``, boolean to mention if the product contains alcohol.
* ``allergen_ids`` to mention the list of allergens.
* ``ingredients`` and ``allergens``. (free texts).

Alls the fields are defined on ``product.product`` model and can be set also
on ``product.template`` models, in a mono variant context.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* It could be great to have the possibility to manage the certification
  document that provide certification organization with the following model
  ``res.company.certification`` and the fields ``company_id``,
  ``organization_id``, ``date_start``, ``date_end``

* In the same way, it could be great to have the possibility to store
  the certification document of each supplier with the following model
  ``res.partner.certification`` and the fields ``partner_id``,
  ``organization_id``, ``date_start``, ``date_end``

* Make a dependency to the new module ``product_net_weight`` and update
  algorithm + create a new module ``product_volumen_price``.
